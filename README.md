Below, you can find the description of your first assignment. Additionally, you
can also find the expected output of this assignment in the Application
Walkthrough section.
As part of your assignment this semester, you are required to develop a Hotel
Reservation System. Accordingly, for this week’s assignment, you are expected
to develop a system that creates a room reservation item and displays the
information about the reservation, which also includes the overall amount due.
Accordingly, you are required to collect StandardRoom reservation data that
includes id, price (per person) and personCount variables. All this information
should be int type and shall be stored on a multidimensional array. Your
application should also have a displayInfo() method which should make use of
the calculatePrice() method to list all rooms and their overall due price. The
overall price should be calculated using the price per person and multiplying
with personCount.
The reservation id variable must increment automatically for each reservation;
which should indicate the room numbers assigned.
You should create few StandardRoom’s and show their information and the
total number of rooms created by implementing a menu as below;
1. Create new Standard Room
2. Display all room information
3. Display the total number rooms
0. Exit
PS: You can use basic C-style arrays.
